Task:
-------------------
VQA-Med 2019 focused on radiology images and four main categories of questions: Modality, Plane, Organ system and Abnormality. These categories are designed with different degrees of difficulty leveraging both classification and text generation approaches. In this second edition of the VQA challenge, we targeted medical questions asking about one element only (e.g. what is the organ principally shown in this mri? in what plane is this mammograph taken? is this a t1 weighted, t2 weighted, or flair image? what is most alarming about this ultrasound?), and that can be answered from the image content without requiring additional medical knowledge or domain-specific inference.  

VQA-Med-2019 Data:
-------------------
The VQA-Med-2019 dataset includes a training set of 3,200 medical images with 12,792 Question-Answer (QA) pairs, a validation set of 500 medical images with 2,000 QA pairs, and a test set of 500 medical images with 500 questions.
